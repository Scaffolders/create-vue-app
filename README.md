# Create Vue App

This is my boilerplate template that I generally use to create my vue apps, to speed up the development and not wasting time configuring it over and over again.

This template uses:

* Typescript as the programming language
* Yarn as the package manager
* Sass as the CSS-preprocessor
* Vite as the bundle builder
* Vue 3
* Vitest as the test runner

If you want to deploy on the cloud your website based on this template, is recommended using the Azure Static Web Apps services, because this template is already
configured to be deployed in this service.


## Configuration

You can run this application in a Docker container (you only need to have installed Docker on your machine) or in your machine (you need to have installed Node and Yarn on your machine).

## Run on Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

And to stop the application the command is:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Run on your machine:

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

Now you are ready to go ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
