# Create Vue App

This is my boilerplate template that I generally use to create my vue apps, to speed up the development and not wasting time configuring it over and over again.

This template uses:

* Typescript as the programming language
* Yarn as the package manager
* Sass as the CSS-preprocessor
* Vite as the bundle builder
* Vue 3
