# Create Vue App

This is my boilerplate template that I generally use to create my vue apps, to speed up the development and not wasting time configuring it over and over again.

This template uses:

* Typescript as the programming language
* Yarn as the package manager
* Sass as the CSS-preprocessor
* Vite as the bundle builder
* Vue 3

If you want to deploy on the cloud your website based on this template, is recommended using the Azure Static Web Apps services, because this template is already
configured to be deployed in this service.
